# DisqusImport
An importer for converting Disqus comments to staticman-style json files.

To use: place your `disqus.xml` file in the `src` directory and run the project.

The Disqus import models (in `Disqus.cs`) were generated by the command `xsd DisqusInternals.xsd Disqus.xsd /classes`. `DisqusInternals.xsd` was downloaded from [http://disqus.com/api/schemas/1.0/internals.xsd](http://disqus.com/api/schemas/1.0/internals.xsd), and `Disqus.xsd` was downloaded from [http://disqus.com/api/schemas/1.0/disqus.xsd](http://disqus.com/api/schemas/1.0/disqus.xsd).
